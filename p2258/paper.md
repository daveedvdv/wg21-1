# Introduction {#intro}

This paper suggests a new syntax for reflection and splicing that differs from
both [@P1240R1] and [@P2237R0]. The syntax in both proposals has various
weaknesses. P1240R1 is largely written using placeholder notation, and while
P2237 offers some concrete improvements, it turns out to have some ambiguity
issues.

We (the authors) considered several notations for the two operations with
respect to several criteria:

- *Expressivity.* The syntax must support a wide array of metaprogramming use
  cases. Broadly, we need syntax to a) inspect the compile-time properties of
  expressions, names, declarations, and entities, b) splice entity references
  and expressions back into source code, and c) expand such splices in contexts
  where pack expansion is allowed.
- *Readability.* Obviously, we'd like our programs to be readable. We want syntax
  that is both visually distinctive yet comprehensible. Because metaprogramming
  (especially splicing) has several a new C++ programming concepts, we think the
  notation should be different than conventional notations for e.g., function
  call, template instantiation, etc.
- *Flexibility.* We shouldn't design notation that prevents future extensions.
  We should also consider future extensions to metaprogramming (like code
  injection) so that we don't end up with wildly different notations for similar
  kinds of functionality.
- *Lack of ambiguity.* The grammar for these terms should be as unambiguous as
  practical, both technically (i.e., not requiring parsing heroics) and visually
  (i.e., not confusing a normal C++ programmer).
- *Implementability.* The notation must be implementable. Syntax (and semantics)
  that cannot be supported by all implementations is not viable.

Section [](#prop) presents the notation we've chosen for reflection and splicing.
Appendix YYY presents other notations and brief analyses.

# Proposal {#prop}

This paper suggests specific syntax for three features of static reflection:
reflecting (Section [](#refl)), splicing (Section [](#splice.refl)), and
pack expansion (Section [](#splice.pack)).  This corresponds to the scope
of [@P1240R1], but does not cover some metaprogramming mechanisms — like
code injection — described in [@P2237R0]. The authors have kepts those
mechanisms in mind, however, while exploring the syntax options described
here.

## Reflection {#refl}

We propose to enable reflecting a source construct using `^` as a unary
operator. Because reflection is such a fundamental (and primitive) operation for
metaprogramming, it should have a simple spelling. The `^` is intended to imply
"lifting" or "raising" a term into the metaprogramming environment.

```cpp
meta::info r1 = ^int;  // reflects the type-id int
meta::info r2 = ^x;    // reflects the id-expression x
meta::info r2 = ^f(x); // reflects the call f(x)
```

The suggested grammar for the reflection is:

:::{.bnf}
- unary-expression
  - ...
  - reflection-expression

- reflection-expression
  - `^` postfix-expression
  - `^` type-id
  - `^` qualified-namespace-specifier
  - `^` qualified-template-specifier
  - `^` `::`
:::

One of the reasons that we opt for this very terse syntax over the prior
`reflexpr(X)` form, is that we anticipate that it will be frequently desirable
to "pass arguments by reflection". Just as it is convenient to "pass an
argument by address/pointer" using the simple `&` prefix, having a simple `^`
will keep invocation syntax light and readable.

Another (weaker) reason to drop `reflexpr(X)` is that it has proven somewhat
unpopular with the many readers of earlier reflection papers.

## Splicing reflections {#splice.refl}

We propose the notation `[: R :]` to denote the splice of a reflection `R`. Here,
the use of bracket notation is explicitly chosen to denote a "gap" in the source
code, filled in by the "reflected value" of `R`. The notation is intentionally
designed to be visually distinctive because it represents a new programming
concept for C++. We prefer to encourage a degree of unfamiliarity.

In general, and without qualification, `[: R :]` splices an [expression]{.bnf}
into the program (assuming `R` reflects a variable, function, or some other
expression). If `R` reflects a type, template, or namespace, the splice operator
must be qualified with an appropriate keyword, except in some contexts where the
meaning is obvious. For example:

```cpp
struct S { struct Inner { }; };
template<int N> struct X;

auto refl = ^S;
auto tmpl = ^X;

void f() {
  typename [:refl:] * x;  // OK: declares x to be a pointer-to-S
  [:refl:] * x;           // error: attempt to multiply int by x
  [:refl:]::Inner i;      // OK: splice as part of a nested-name-specifier
  typename [:refl:]{};    // OK: default-constructs an S temporary
  using T = [:refl:];     // OK: operand must be a type
  struct C : [:refl:] {}; // OK: base classes are types
  template [:tmpl:]<0>;   // OK: names the specialization
  [:tmpl:] < 0 > x;       // error: attempt to compare X with 0
}
```

Note that the extra annotations are necessary even in non-dependent contexts.

That said, we expect SG7 will entertain future proposals that relax the
requirement for qualifying syntax when the splice operand is not value-dependent
(as is done in P2237R0). However, there are two main obstacles to adopting such
proposals. Is readability hurt by the omission of keywords? Does the
implementation require parsing heroics? (There is no implementation experience
for this abbreviated notation in P2237.) Note that requiring keywords now does
not limit our ability to make them optional later.

That said, annotations differentiating type and non-type
[template-argument]{.bnf}s in a [template-argument-list]{.bnf} can be omitted.
This is a special case that allows reflections (and packs thereof) to be
forwarded to a template taking mixed type/value template arguments or to an
overload set where the kind and type of arguments may vary. For example:

```cpp
template<typename T> void f();
template<int N> void f();

template<meta::info Refl>
void g() {
  f<[:Refl:]>();
}
```

Here, `Refl` can reflect either a type or integer constant expression. To 
"force" `Refl` to be spliced as a type or an expression by adding `typename`
or enclsoing the splice in parentheses.

```cpp
template<meta::info Refl>
void g() {
  f<typename [:Refl:]>(); // splices a type
  f<([:Refl:])>();        // splices an expression
}
```

The addition of splicing requires modification of the following grammar terms.

<!--
  FIXME [DV]: I don't think that grammar is quite right.  I'll get back to this
  later.

  [AS]: It's almost certainly wrong :)

## Splicing ranges {#splice.pack}

The ability to expand a range of reflections into a list of function arguments,
template arguments, base classes, etc. is an important use case for
metaprogramming. However, the expansion of non-packs is a novel feature and
requires new syntax to nominate a term as being expandable. Our preferred
approach is to require an ellipsis *before* the pattern being expanded. For
example:

```cpp
using T = std::tuple<int, ...[:range_of_types:]..., bool>;
```

Here, `range_of_types` is a sequence of type reflections. The leading `...`
nominates the splice as expandable, and the trailing `...` explicitly indicates
its expansion.  Note that the `...` prefixes the entire pattern to be expanded,
not just the splice.  So for example (expanding a pointer-to-member type pattern):

```cpp
using T = std::tuple<int, ... int [:range_of_types:]::*..., bool>;  // Okay.
```

as opposed to:

```cpp
using T = std::tuple<int, int ...[:range_of_types:]::*..., bool>;  // Error.
```



<!--
[DV] FIXME: As discussed, this might not be optimal because "packified" ranges
are perhaps not _quite_ like packs after all.

[AS]: I think it's probably fine not to adress this here.
-->

We propose to allow such nominations in almost every context where expansion is
allowed (and no others). There are a number of reasons for choosing this syntax.
First, a prefix annotation is necessary to be implementable by all
vendors.[^impl] Second, the choice of `...` is chosen specifically because of
the symmetry with expansion "operator" and the way in which packs are declared,
where the `...` precedes the identifier. Finally, in dependent cases it can
disambiguate the expansion of patterns that contains a variadic template
parameter and, potentially, a range splice.  For example:

```cpp
template<typename ... Ts>
using X = std::tuple<...[:refl_func<Ts>:]...>;  // ?
```
Here, the trailing `...` certainly expands over the pack `Ts`. However, the
compiler cannot tell if `refl_func<Ts>` produces a single reflection value
or a range of such values.
<!--
[DV] FIXME: These kinds of situations seem tricky.  I currenlt think
that range-splice expansion and variadic template expansion should be
separate phases.  Or maybe patterns shouldn't allowed to be mixed?
That seems wrong, somehow.
-->

<!-- 
[DV] FIXME: Should we disallow `sizeof...(...Rs)`?  I think we should because it
feels different. However, it's certainly implementable.

[AS]: Fixedish.
-->

[^impl]: Not all implementations preserve tokens during or construct syntax
trees during parsing. The prefix ellipsis in these context would alert the
compiler that it needs to preserve those tokens for subsequent expansion.

For fold expressions, at most one cast-expression can be nominated as expandable.

```cpp
(...[:range:] && ...)      // Right fold over a splice
(... && ...[:range:])      // Left fold over a splice
(0.0 + ... + ...[:range:]) // Left binary fold over a splice
```

Semantically, the expansion of such expressions is just like the expansion of
normal template and function parameter packs. Here are some examples:

```cpp
fn(0, 1, ...[:range:]...); // OK: expansion after normal arguments
fn(...[:range:]..., 0, 1); // OK: expansion before normal arguments
fn(...[:range:] * 2...);   // OK: [:range:] * 2 is the pattern
fn(...[:r1:] * [:r2:]...); // OK: iff r1 and r2 have equal size
```

We currently suggest two contexts where nomination is not allowed.

Nominating expressions for use with the `sizeof...` operator seems unnecessary.
The size of a range can be queried using `r.size()` or
`std::ranges::distance(r)`. We don't need a language-based alternative to these
operations.

<!--
[DV] FIXME: Here, we should probably add your observation about immediate expansion
as opposed to deduction in parameter list contexts.

[AS] Added.
-->

The second context is in function and template parameter lists:

```cpp
void f(... [:range_of_types:] ...args)
```

This seems like a plausible use of splicing, but there are some deep technical
questions we have yet to address. In particular, `args` is kind of like a
coventional pack, but not really because it's not dependent and thus not
deducible. We'll need to
introduce new core language machinery to support the declaration of these new
kinds of packs. Note that this seems closely related to the declaration of packs
in discussed P1061R1 [@P1061R1], P1858R2 [@P1858R2], and P2277R0 [@P2277R0].

There is a potential redundancy in the notation. It could be argued that a term
nominated for expansion must always be expanded, so we could omit the trailing
ellipsis, and this would be true today. However, this "optimization" is not
applicable in fold expressions and may not be future-proof. In the future, we
might introduce a "pass-by-reflection" convention that accepts unexpanded
(non-splice) parameter packs.
On the flip side, the issue with function and template parameter lists illustrates
that the expansions resulting from range-splices aren't _exactly_ like the
expansions resulting from variadic template parameters. We could therefore
distinguish the two by having range-based patterns be expanded through the
prefix ellipsis and variadic template patterns be expanded through the
postfix ellipsis.  In cases where the two are combined, such as:

```cpp
template<typename ... Ts>
void f(... std::pair<[:range_of_types:], Ts> ...args)
```
we could then ordain that the range-based pattern is expanded first.
For now, however, we choose to require ellipses for nomination and range-based
pattern expansion.

To support this feature, we need to change the following grammar additions:

:::{.bnf}
- initializer-list:
  - `...`~opt~ initializer-clause `...`~opt~
  - initializer-list `,` `...`~opt~ initializer-clause `...`~opt~
:::

:::{.bnf}
- template-argument-list:
  - `...`~opt~ template-argument `...`~opt~
  - template-argument-list `,` `...`~opt~ template-argument `...`~opt~
:::

:::{.bnf}
- base-specifier-list:
  - `...`~opt~ base-specifier `...`~opt~
  - base-specifier-list `,` `...`~opt~ base-specifier `...`~opt~
:::

:::{.bnf}
- mem-initializer-list:
  - `...`~opt~ mem-initializer `...`~opt~
  - mem-initializer-list `,` `...`~opt~ mem-initializer `...`~opt~
:::

:::{.bnf}
- fold-expression
  - `(` `...`~opt~ cast-expression fold-operator `...` `)`
  - `(` `...` fold-operator `...`~opt~ cast-expression `)`
  - `(` `...`~opt~ cast-expression fold-operator `...` fold-operator `...`~opt~ cast-expression `)`
:::

In a [fold-expression]{.bnf}, at most one [cast-expression]{.bnf} can be nominated
as expandable or contain a pack reference.

# Conclusions

We think the notation presented here is concise, visually distinctive, and
generally readable and writable. We have also considered the implementability
of the proposed grammar and believe that the grammar proposes no serious
or novel challenges. Furthermore, in working through use cases, we have
found it to be consistent and composable.

We therefore request that SG7 approve further work building on these specific
choices.

We plan to revisit the details of the splicing ranges if appropriate.
